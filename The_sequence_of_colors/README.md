# Guess the sequence of balls

## Description
The Guess the Sequence of Balls project is an interactive game in which the player is asked to guess a sequence of 4 balls of different colors. To detect a sequence of balls, the OpenCV library is used, which allows you to process images and recognize objects on them. If the sequence is correct, the player will see the corresponding result on the screen.
