# Frequency analysis of symbols in an image

## Description:
The project "Frequency analysis of symbols in an image" is a program that compiles a frequency dictionary of symbols in an image symbols.png using the alphabet represented in the image alphabet_ext.png. The program recognizes the characters in the image and calculates their frequency of occurrence. It then outputs the percentage of character recognition by comparing the calculated frequencies with the known characters of the alphabet.
